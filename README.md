# FiletypeConverter
Recursively scans a directory structure and converts selected proprietery document formats to pdf or txt and places the converted files in a mirror directory structure where they can be viewed with open format viewers. 
The original directory structure is unaltered.
For now supports the conversion of Microsoft Office files.
